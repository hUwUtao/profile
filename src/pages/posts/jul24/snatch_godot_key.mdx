I have a big love with a sport called "game extraction". Assets are not going anywhere, but for preservation and study of myself, assets extraction is a hobby that I will never miss.

You will need some `C` knowledges, binary and a simple idea on how compiler works on branch optimization.

### 1. Godot engine

Godot engine is a multiplatform game engine, thus it have cross-compile toolchains, despite this OP has no idea which one, having knowledge of the computer prone a bit useful.

Starting from Godot 3.1+ (backported) and Godot 4.0+, they implemented script encryption. Pack encryption are from GD4.0, but maybe it will be my next nemesis. This guide aims on Godot 3.1 with only script encryption.

To break something, you need your toolchain. Luckily, [GDSDecomp](https://github.com/GDRETools/gdsdecomp) is come at granted, with preimplemented package, assets readings and project reconstruction.

After a bit decompilation, the tool tells me that the project is *probably* Godot 3.5.

### 2. The native

I targeted a game on Android, which have a native output for armv8a and armv7l. Again, you need a toolchain, but for newbie, advanced one like Ghidra will prone useful. Atleast know where the reference to jump to.
Also, Ghidra support most arch, including armv8a.

- You will need to decompile either the main `exe` or `libgodot*.so`, only one arch is needed.
- GD3.1+ backport: you need to jump to string `GDScript::load_byte_code`
  - Jump to the only function that reference the string. If you have issue on other decompiler, take the address and search it in the assembly
  - On Ghidra or anywhere generate `C`: find the &DAT_xxx[] reference right up to the GDScript debug function call.
- GD4.0+: (Check this tutorial, it have more up-to-date signatures and build toolchain)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWjuFmYGoSY]

### What?

> This step require to clone (or download) the right version of Godot to explore. Remember, the extractor tool hinted the version the project was made of.

Knowing that all version of Godot use `C` constant `script_encryption_key`, it is a 32 byte length byte-array added during build. However, you cannot find it like a string, as it is byte,
and you also cannot find it by actual variable initialization, since the compiler optimize it as actual static part of the program.

First, needing to know where the key is used. Luckily, the constant is rarely used, and the engine code is populated with various debug string. A \[static] string reference near the access can leak the presence of constant address.

For example, 3.5 have the `GDScript::load_byte_code` actually using the key. A debug function leaked the function name its belong, and the file its belong. It is obvious that this function has a string reference presence, so finding the address within the asm is easily done.

After reaching near the constant access, the reference can be found within the scope of the function. It is exactly a few lines and parameter inbetween, but it is likely the same as the `C` codebase.

However, a compiler can inline the code (for good deed optimization), leading to various instruction resemble another function outside the current scope or namespace. A branch inbetween can keep the instruction away from the string, meaning that even within same function, it is pretty confusing and hard to find the constant key reference.

### Mitigation with optimization

After wasting **SIX HOUR** of name mapping, source code side to side check, I just found that I referenced the wrong version of the source code. The branch is missing, but I traversally found a confusing way to hide some branch away from the string easily:

- A complex branching in within can even force the compiler to split into an independent function or a label ("LAB_xxx", hello please someone lmk if this actually armv8a thing?)
- A negative branching can nest the whole code in within a so-flipped branch order, even in-side-out
- A really big function block can be wrapped in within (perhaps branch pred?)

This might keep away string from the access without compromising too much code clarity.

There is another tactic I used before. It involving obscurity, and it is JSF*ck, a transformation always result in a few set of character and repeated value for a javascript constant. The key could be generated without leaving a constant in the stub, leading to harder execution or simulation done to achieve the key.

### Finale

Deassembly to find encryption code is not something new, but it is hardly practiced. Game protection may affect performance vary, based on its complexity and protection mechanism. 
However, maybe it was unnecessary to have it, since what if some one want to just see "behind the scene"? This even powering good culture like modding, fan filmmaking, etc.
Although, some environment like competitive games may prone needing for obfuscation to keeps its intergerity.
