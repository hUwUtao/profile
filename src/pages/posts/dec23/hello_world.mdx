What a lovely day, imagine about the worst way to sort a segmented allocation like this:

```c
#define swp(a, b) a=a^b;b=a^b;a=a^b;
void bsort(int *arr) {
  int size = sizeof(*arr) / sizeof(arr[0]), x, y;
  for(x=0; x<size; x++)
    for(y=0; y<size; y++)
      if(arr[x] > arr[y])
        swp(arr[x], arr[y]);
}
```

Just to convince you to know I have a plenty knowledge about this language, 
doesn't mean this piece of code could ever working in real life (are swapping pointers legit?).

## Try this at home

- Download Linux kernel from [kernel.org](https://kernel.org)
- Run `make menuconfig` and select every options possible (3+ hours of compile time)
- Flash it into your ~~1000$~~ router, *hopefully work*

## One last thing

- I'm just testing out `@astro/mdx` capabilities. More posts coming soon!
