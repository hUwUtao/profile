What a lovely day, imagine about the worst way to sort a segmented allocation like this:

```c
#define swp(a, b) a=a^b;b=a^b;a=a^b;
void bsort(int *arr) {
  int size = sizeof(*arr) / sizeof(arr[0]), x, y;
  for(x=0; x<size; x++)
    for(y=0; y<size; y++)
      if(arr[x] > arr[y])
        swp(arr[x], arr[y]);
}
```

Just to convince you to know I have a plenty knowledge about this language, doesn't mean this piece of code pass the coverage. Worst, it output the wrong, not pass a single check

## There is a few things to notice

- The code is built inside a container, which might even elder than your host OS (did you `emerge libc` your host yet?)
- Did the `cc` flags just ok to let the binary goes somewhere else?

## Now try something else

- Download [linux kernel](https://kernel.org)
- Flash it into your home TV remote

## Last but last

- I made this to test out the capabilities of `@astro/mdx` which is cool anyways. Future post incomming!!!
